# Dynamis

> **Unlock your athletic potential through AI-powered motion analysis and intelligent feedback.**

---

## Overview

**Dynamis** is a real-time sports training platform that captures an athlete's movement, analyzes key biomechanical features, and delivers AI-generated coaching feedback to optimize performance, form, and injury prevention.

Leveraging computer vision, real-time data processing, and large language models (LLMs), Dynamis helps athletes train smarter â€” unlocking the full power of their motion.

## Architecture

- **Frontend (Vite + React):**
  - Captures video stream and extracts body pose landmarks.
  - Sends batches of movement frames to backend for analysis.
  - Plays AI-generated audio feedback to the user.

- **Backend (FastAPI):**
  - Processes real-time pose data and extracts key athletic features.
  - Summarizes movement metrics (e.g., elbow extension, wrist snap, hip stability).
  - Sends feature summaries to LLM for evaluation.
  - Returns a coaching feedback message to frontend.

- **AI Layer:**
  - Google Gemini interprets biomechanical summaries.
  - OpenAI TTS converts feedback into dynamic spoken advice.
